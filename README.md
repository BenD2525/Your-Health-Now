# Your Health Now

Your Health Now is a website aimed at users who wish to learn more about health and fitness, and who would like to be able to log their weight and run stats. I have also included the ability to track the user's weight using a chart to visualise the data. The user is able to sign up, log in and log out, and only the user's own stats will be available to them. The user is able to update their stats with the latest entry, edit any of their existing stats and delete any they wish to delete. The health history table will be updated as such with any additions or changes the user has made, making this a handy site to log and track your health stats.
